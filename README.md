Integrated Car Recommendation, Price Prediction, and Classification System
Welcome to the Integrated Car Recommendation, Price Prediction, and Classification System! This system leverages advanced research, machine learning algorithms, and data processing techniques to revolutionize the car buying experience.

Features
Car Recommendation: Based on the car's name and price, our intelligent algorithms provide personalized recommendations tailored to your preferences and budget.

Price Prediction: Our system accurately predicts future car prices by analyzing historical data, market trends, and employing various pre-processing techniques.

Classification System: Cars are classified into segments based on price ranges, features, and specifications, allowing for efficient exploration of specific car categories.

Research Papers
This system incorporates two research papers:

Prediction Algorithms: This paper investigates different pre-processing techniques to enhance data quality and reliability, ensuring accurate price predictions.

Classification Techniques: The second paper evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate methods for classifying cars based on their features and price ranges.
